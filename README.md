# Org-GTD-Complete: A comprehensive GTD workflow system for Emacs org-mode

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)

This package provides a complete implementation of David Allen's "Getting Things Done" methodology within Emacs org-mode. It covers all five core GTD workflow steps (Capture, Clarify, Organize, Reflect, Engage) and fully supports the six-level Horizon of Focus, Natural Planning Model, Weekly Review process, Contexts system, Two-Minute Rule, and all standard GTD lists (Projects, Next Actions, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe, Reference).

The system also includes inbox processing, project planning, periodic review cycles, reference material management, trigger lists, brainstorming tools, and organizing principles, enabling comprehensive vertical and horizontal focus management from daily tasks to life goals.

M-x package-install org-gtd-complete
